            <p>
            </p>
            <p>This site and the mobile applications and services available in connection with this site and mobile application (the "App") are made available to you by Abdullah Alhaider ("I", "Me"). Subject to these Terms of Service, including those set forth in the Privacy Policy (the “Terms”). By accessing, using or downloading any materials from the App, you agree to follow and be bound by the Terms, which may be updated by me from time to time without notice to you. The App is not intended for and is not designed to attract children under 13 years of age. If you do not agree with the Terms, please do not use this App. BY CONTINUING TO USE THE APP, YOU ARE INDICATING YOUR AGREEMENT TO THE TERMS AND ALL REVISIONS THEREOF.</p>
    
            <p>I reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the App or any portion thereof with or without notice. You agree that I shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the App or any portion thereof.</p>
    
            <p>Payments</p>
    
            <p>If you choose to buy a subscription, you must designate and provide information about your preferred payment method (e.g., credit card, online payment service, in-app purchase using your iTunes account, or any other payment method made available by us) (“Payment Method”). You will immediately be charged for these fees after you tap to buy a subscription. You agree to pay all fees incurred in connection with your username and password for your subscription account.</p>
    
            <p>Fees and Renewals</p>
    
            <p>You may elect buy a content subscription ("Content Subscription") and pay membership fees on a recurring basis. All membership fees are payable in advance. Membership fees will be billed automatically to the Payment Method at the start of the chosen period, as applicable, and will auto-renew until your membership is terminated. The renewal membership fees will be the same as the initial charges unless you are otherwise notified in advance. You authorize us to charge your Payment Method for the appropriate membership charges and fees and for any other purchases you elect to make via the App. We reserve the right to increase membership fees or to institute new fees at any time upon reasonable notice posted in advance on this App. If you upgrade your membership or add new categories of service to your account, such changes may result in a new billing date effective upon the date you elect such upgrade or addition. ALL PURCHASES ARE FINAL AND NO REFUND WILL BE GIVEN FOR UNUSED PORTIONS OF YOUR INITIAL OR ANY MEMBERSHIP PERIOD.</p>
    
            <p>Cancellation</p>
    
            <p>You may cancel your Content Subscription by visiting the subscription management options within iOS. The cancellation of a membership will go into effect at the end of your current billing cycle, and you will have the same level of access to the App through the remainder of such billing cycle. When your Content Subscription ends, your account will enter free mode. No refunds or credits will be provided by us upon cancellation. You can renew your Content Subscription at anytime without opening a new account, provided that additional fees may apply if you decide to upgrade to a Content Subscription at a later date.</p>
    
            <p>User Conduct</p>
    
            <p>You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password associated with your account and for restricting access to your password and to your computer while logged into the App. You accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or from your computer. We endeavor to use reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to your account.

            <h1 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>The app is owned, operated, and maintained by me, Abdullah Alhaider. I respect your right to privacy and share your concern about the security of any data you may submit via our mobile application (“the App”).</p>
    
            <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. We don’t want to be creepy stalkers or evil spammers. We have a few fundamental principles:</p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li>
                <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
                <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>The following statement discloses the guidelines Abdullah Alhaider has established for protecting the information you provide to us during your visit to the site and while using the app.</p>
    
            <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
    
            <p>We may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to our website and users of the app. For example, we may aggregate anonymous location data to report resort popularity or publish a report on trends in the usage
                of The app.</p>
    
            <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
    
            <p>Like most website operators, Abdullah Alhaider collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring
                site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use the site.</p>
    
            <h2>Data Security &amp; Retention</h2>
    
            <p>The app uses industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of personal information during transmissions to google servers.</p>
            <p>The app do not not communicate to any servers other than google's servers for the core features.</p>
            <p>Any Google user data is deleted at the time the app is deleted.</p>
    
            <p>We assure you that we do not sell any of your personal data, including user Google data, to any third parties. That is prohibited.</p>
    
            <h2>Exclusions</h2>
    
            <p>This privacy policy does not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to us, such as feature requests and feedback sent via our support channels. All unsolicited information shall be deemed to be non-confidential
                and we shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such unsolicited information to others without limitation or attribution.</p>
    
            <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    
            <p>While I continue to work hard to protect your data, no transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure, and I cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Abdullah Alhaider. Transmitting personal information is done at your own risk.</p>
    
            <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
    
            <p>If Abdullah Alhaider makes changes to any terms or conditions of this privacy policy, these changes will be posted on the site in a timely manner. We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please
                review it frequently. In case of a business transaction in which a portion or all of Abdullah Alhaider’s business is acquired, we will notify you as described above in this paragraph.</p>
    
            <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    
            <p>If you have any additional questions or concerns about this policy or our information practices, please feel free to contact us at any time at <a href="mailto:support@The app.com">support@The app.com</a>.</p>
